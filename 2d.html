		<p><img class="submission" src="assets/2d/cloud_9_concept_art_character__male__by_mckenneyjp_df528gb-pre.jpg">This concept art was made for a group game project called Cloud-9. This was made as a design concept for the main character of the game. As an aspiring Game Designer and Artist, it was a lot of fun and a big learning experience to be able to focus on my fields of interest in this project.

		<p><img class="submission" src="assets/2d/hollow-knight.png">I just like to doodle stuff. My friend wanted me to play a game over the semester. 30 hours later, i doodled this NPC. I’d like to possibly have doodling involved in my future career. I have a ways to go. But I am happy with this result.

		<h2>Salem Radey, Artist, Senior</h2>
		<br>
		<p><img class="submission" src="assets/2d/mycelium_witch_by_crovvus_df59qau-pre.jpg">“Mycelium Witch” was my capstone portfolio project. I spent about 3 months concepting and working through every step of a concept art pipeline before I got to this rendered splash art. I want to eventually be a concept artist or art generalist for a game company, so familiarizing myself with the process helped immensely.

		<p><img class="submission" src="assets/2d/magma_lady_by_crovvus_df59r5r-pre.jpg">This was work for a card art illustration for a collection card game that didn’t make the final cut. I love making original character illustrations which lends to my goals of either working as an independent illustrator or as a concept artist / art generalist on a game development team!

		<h2>Noah Santini, Creator, Junior</h2>
		<br>
		<p><img class="submission" src="assets/2d/Car-Concept.png">This is concept art for a show I have been in the works in. Designed the characters, developed an art style, wrote the story, I even started to learn how to draw for this project. The ultimate goal is to pitch this idea to a studio and have it turn into a full-fledged show!
