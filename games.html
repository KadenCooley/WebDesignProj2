Our team took heavy inspiration by FromSoftware  in attempt to create a dungeon which resembles a playstyle to a “souls-like” game. The key features of this project includes an in depth inventory system, third person movement systems with blend tree animations, AI state machines, and expansive level design.

The independent study was in hand tracking and was a way for me to explore and learn about the new VR hand-tracking capabilities of the Oculus Quest 2. For this project, I focused on gesture recognition and essentially created a game of Rock Paper Scissors in VR! In this game, you will be facing an AI opponent in rock paper scissors and at the end of each round, you will give them a thumbs up to start the next round. It plays to the first player to reach 3 points.

My main goal during this time was to get serious about learning the Unity Engine, so while not perfect, it is a much larger project than anything I had attempted before. In the future, I hope to expand on what is already present and remove as many bugs as i can find as they crop up.

I (Lucas Ackman) plan on going into programming, hoping to work in VR games since those are the games I get the most joy from playing, and I already have a few projects within which I’ve started. Unfortunately, none of my VR projects are at a point where I feel comfortable sharing them as most of them are simply for learning the main mechanics of VR development.

When we first started we all wanted to show off what we have learned so far but also to try out news things and learn new things along the way. Jacob made his first 3D character with this game, this is Aidan’s first 3D game, and this is first time Joey worked with third person camera, movement, and animations. Cloud-9 is a space themed collect-a-thon, you are a passenger of a vacation spaceship when suddenly you feel a rumble. The spaceship is under attack and your goal is to find parts to help you escape. For the demo level you are finding gun pieces to destroy the drone and move onto the next room.

I’m interested in making video games like the ones I enjoy, in the hopes that I inspire others in the future to also love video games enough to want to study them or make more. I also like to involve my queer perspective in my games when the opportunity arises, as a unique way to express myself and my experiences, and in an attempt to make gaming a safer place for queer people and other minorities. This game is inspired by a unique mechanic I thought was interesting from a retro game, and I wanted to see how I could design levels around it.

My vision for the game as a story-driven top-down shooter with an ethical gacha system is still months away from being realized, but my work thusfar has produced the demo you see here: a core gameplay loop that I’m super proud of.

Geonocturn: The Boiler has been a work-in-progress game since February and it took up the role as my Capstone project in my MAGD minor this semester. With a semester of Unity practice, but years of coding experience and self-taught doodling, I decided I would go head first into making a tile-based exploration and combat game built around a narrative. In the future, I hope I can continue, make, or lead projects just like this in an indie environment to tell stories and make fun experiences.

This connects to our career goals as all of us want to be involved in the game development field. All of us are very proud to have made this small game in a short amount of time, especially since we all learned a lot of lessons during its creation.
