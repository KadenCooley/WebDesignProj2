This video is a collection of work I completed for my MAGD Capstone and Art Studio classes where I learned and applied many cool new techniques in Adobe After Effects. I had a lot of fun developing the artistic aspect of these videos, but I was also able to apply the practical experience to my job at the UC where I mainly deal with animated promotional material. When I graduate, I hope to use these videos alongside my motion graphics work from the UC to demonstrate that I’m proficient in many facets of animation. Whether it be more artistic creative projects like these or just some contract work for a company, I’m always looking to improve.

I used another friend’s background art and music from Incompetech, but the sprite, animation, and text were all done by me. At the time I was also watching one of my friends play the mobile game Twisted Wonderland, and I was inspired by their style of sprite animation and wanted to try out something similar for myself. Some of my favorite things to do is start projects on a whim, combine people’s work, and spend way too much time animating and drawing things for no reason at all, so I really got to flex those muscles for this project.
